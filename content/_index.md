# Welcome

I'm Tom - a solutions architect from the UK and working in the technology industry. For work, I specialise in secure digital transformation. At home, I enjoy free and open source software, Linux, computers and tinkering.

I built this space to share content I hope others will find useful. I also maintain a few projects in my spare time - you can check them out in the projects section.
